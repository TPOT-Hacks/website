For our first hack, we're keeping it simple but fun! Build a command-line greeting program that:

## Requirements

1. Takes a user's name as input
2. Generates a unique greeting based on:
   - Time of day
   - Day of the week
   - User's name length
   - A random element of your choice

## Bonus Challenges

- Add ASCII art to your greeting
- Support multiple languages
- Make it installable as a global CLI tool

## Resources

- [Command Line Apps in Rust](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html)
- [Python argparse Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html)
- [Node.js CLI Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/command-line/command-line-apps)

Use any programming language you prefer. Focus on making your greeter unique and fun!
